### dotfiles
#
# --- Initialization:
#
#     git init --bare "$HOME/.cfg"
#
# --- Installation:
#
#     alias config='git --git-dir="$HOME/.cfg" --work-tree="$HOME"'
#     config checkout
#
#     We could have just initialized the repository directly in the home
#     folder, but the advantage of doing it with a bare repo and a work tree
#     is that normal uses of `git` won't try and use the home folder if you
#     aren't in a git repository.
#
# --- Usage:
#
#     You can use `git add/commit/status/push` as usual, just replace `git`
#     with `config`. Note that before using `add`, you need to list the file
#     below.
#
# --- How it works:
#
#     The following line prevents Git from scanning any folders any number of
#     levels underneath the repository work tree (home folder). Unlike if we
#     used a `*` only, this allows you to scan a folder without also including
#     including its contents by listing it with a `!` (see the next section).
#     If we used a single `*`, we would have needed to list each folder to scan
#     like `!.config` `.config/*` instead of just `!.config`.
/**
#
#     The following line causes Git to track this file.
!/.gitignore
#
# --- Adding dotfiles:
#
#     To add dotfiles, let git scan each parent directory (note: this doesn't
#     cause git to actually include files from it) like:
#
#         !/.config/
#         !/.config/myapp/
#
#     The leading slash is important, as it forces the path matching to start
#     at the root of the repository, not subdirectories too.
#
#     Then, after you've included the parent directories, you also need to
#     include files from it, like:
#
#         !/.config/myapp/myapp.conf
#
#     You can also use wildcards, like:
#
#         !/.config/myapp/*.conf
#
#     Or include everything in the directory, like:
#
#         !/.config/myapp/*
#
#     Note that a wildcard like that only includes files. To also include
#     subdirectories, you need to list them the same way as mentioned at the
#     beginning of this section, like:
#
#         !/.config/myapp/*
#         !/.config/myapp/stuff/*
#
#     Alternatively, you can include all subdirectories and their files
#     recursively with something like:
#
#         !/.config/myapp/**
#
# --- Example:
#
#         !/.Xresources
#         !/.config/
#         !/.config/mpv/
#         !/.config/mpv/**
#         !/.config/i3
#         !/.config/i3/config
#
# --- FAQ:
#
#   : Can I safely use `git reset`?
#     Yes, you can. Even when using `git reset --hard`, the only files which
#     will be touched by git are the ones listed here.
#
#   : How can I see which on-disk files may be touched by git?
#     Use the command:
#
#         ( git status --short | grep '^?' | cut -d" " -f2- && git ls-files ) | sort -u`
#
#     That will list all files which git is currently aware of (i.e. files in
#     the current commit + files being staged + files on disk).
#
#   : Will this be slow with a large home folder?
#     No, it won't. This is because the `/**` ignore prevents git from even
#     scanning the directories.
#
#   : Will this gitignore file interfere with my repositories?
#     No.
